# blazor-templates
A collection of project templates for blazor

The goal of this project is to maintain a set of project templates that get rid of the main challenges with new blazor projects (e.g. when one wants to use material design, one first needs to edit&remove a lot of files, before the project is properly set up).

# Installation

Add the templates to your machine by running

```
dotnet new -i BlazorTemplates
```

# Source code for templates

The source code for the templates can be found in the [templates](https://github.com/blazor-templates/blazor-templates/tree/main/templates) folder.
