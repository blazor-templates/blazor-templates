# blazor-templates
A collection of project templates for blazor

The goal of this project is to maintain a set of project templates that get rid of the main challenges with new blazor projects (e.g. when one wants to use material design, one first needs to edit&remove a lot of files, before the project is properly set up).

For the moment, this repo will only serve as a wish list. The actual creation of templates will only begin once the official templates for .NET 5 are released, so that the templates here can be based on that.

# Source code for templates

The source code for the templates can be found in the respective repo, see [this list](https://github.com/blazor-templates).
